			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Titanic left Southampton for New York with the legal minimum of 20 lifeboats which were the luxury of the First Class. 
													    The White Star Line staff was deferential to the First Class in all things, so it was natural that the launching of the lifeboats began on the First Class decks. 
														There were no lifeboats on the Third Class, so it is clear that, regardless of gender, the passenger's class was a great influence on whether or not a passenger was going to survive.</p>
														
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honour and shame ruled society in 1912. Gentlemen were expected to be honourable and feared being shamed. Men aboard the Titanic, especially those among the upper class, had to weigh their own survival with doing what society would deem the right thing. To survive but live in shame was a risk some men would not take. Different men, despite which class they belonged to, made different decisions.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men in First Class had no better than a one in three chance of surviving, so compared to women, even women from steerage, they fared poorly. Compared to men from other classes, they did remarkably well. At the time when most of the lifeboats from the First Class decks were launching, it was not certain among the passengers that the Titanic was doomed, and many of the men from First Class who could have gone aboard a lifeboat elected to remain behind.</p>

			As Lawrence Beesley, a Second Class passenger, reported in his 1912 book, "The Loss of the SS Titanic", a false rumour that men were allowed to board lifeboats on the port side 
			caused many men to cross over to the side of the ship where they had a much smaller chance of being allowed on board a lifeboat.</p>
