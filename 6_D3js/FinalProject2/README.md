##Summary

	On this project I wrote a story on the titanic data to demonstrate that, not only women were more likely to survive the Titanic Tragedy, but that there was a specific side of the boat where it the "women first" rule was  strictly being enforced so it was easier for them to get to a life boat
   


##Design  
      
	  There are 4 graphs on this story, all leading to the conclusion that women were more likely to survive the titanic tragedy and that there were one side of the ship that really enforced the "women first" rule

    	1) Graph 1 shows that men, regardless of class, had a low survival chance than woman. I chose a stack bar to display that because it seemed like a good option to visually separate 3 categories, with 2 values each;		
		2) The second graph analyses only women survival rate between classes. I chose to use a percentage stacked bar because I'm comparing percentages among two classes and also displaying the values as a second option for the user;
		3) The third graph shows the percentage of men on each boat, ordered by launch order and coloured by bot side. Is chose a bar chart because he size of the bar gives visual indication of main measure being plotted. Given the small size of the red bars we can easily conclude that not many men boarded from the port side of the boath
		4) The forth graph serves as an auxiliary to the previous, where I sum all the boats in one value. I chose a pie chart with series because I needed two show 2 values (men and women - the "pies") by two classes (port and starboard - the series) and it produces a good visualization.
