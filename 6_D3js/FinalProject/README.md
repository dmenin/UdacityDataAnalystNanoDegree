# Project 6 - Data Visualization with D3.js


##Summary

     The Visualization aims to help students on the Intro to Machine Learning course from the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree to work on their final project, which consists on building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

##Design  
     
      The idea is to select one of the measures (like salary for example) and show one bar plot with the actual values and a second bar plot with the normalized values (z-score). Is is also possible to select a second measure and see a scatter plot between both of them. On all the plots, the colour identifies whether the person is a POI or not
      Design Changes:

    	1) Implemented feedback 1 by adding a global <div> tag to center the visualization




##Feedback \ Versions

    - v1: First version submitted
    - v2: Feedback received:

> I really have nothing substantive to say about your visualization ... except the obvious: it's clever, well done (the standardization makes the distinctions between levels especially clear), and would have been a huge asset when I was doing that project.
> (One minor detail is that the graphs would look better front and center ... they are lower left on my screen, so I have to scroll a bit to see the top graphs fully (maybe some of the text below the graphs, some above, with the graphs centered). As I say, a minor issue.)
> Very nice work!
